Welcome to BitleSpeak 
---------------------

Version 0.1.2 July 20, 2010

  BitleSpeak is a minimalist text to speech toolbar for UNIX like operating 
systems. BitleSpeak has all the basic features of a tts front end, with more
advanced features like mp3 encoding, and follow along highlighting coming
in the near future. In addition to being actively developed, Bitle has one other
advantage over other speech toolbars, that is the ability to support multiple 
speech engines, and audio subsystems. No more dreading machines with 
pulseaudio; just set it and forget it. Note this is not a full screen reader
it only reads text from within documents, and web-pages. If you need a screen
reader get Orca.
