# What is this
 This is a Windows text to speech program, meant for people with Cortical visual impairment, spastic eye muscles, and all other forms of non ocular visual impairment. I also had intended eventually to add features for dyslexica. and features for the speech impaired as well. Programs to address these need don't exist in the open source world, and in the comerical world can run anywhere from $60-$1,600 depending on the speific features you need. And tend to be crash prone resource hogging pieces of Elaphant dung. One day i got fed up, with one such piece of dung made by a company which i shall only call DTL PLEHTXET :P and said merde temps pour certains python, and so after a few months i had something that worked, and everything was going *great*, and then the lawyers got involved.
  
  # Oh No Lawyers
  Long story short I have never gotten an opinion one way or the other on the possible legal issues. Five years is long enough for this to wait in limbo. If someone wants to send me a scary letter about it, I'm not hard to find
  
  # Can I use it?
  
  Sadly no you can't not currently anyhow it is five years old, but the important thing is about this. Is it a well commented example of  *how* to bind to software speech synthizers. If time permits i will restructure the GUI code to something more modern. But the code in win  bitlespeak/bitle/win32 is still valid as of windows 8.1 and they shouldn't have changed much for Windows 10, or so the Microsoft documentation seems to indicate. If you want to build software for dissabled people by all meanss steal my code. I'd even be open to giving out an ISC Licensed version of the just the windows tts stuff if someone asks
